# Custom_AI using RAG and Langchain
#RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that enhances the responses of large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from external sources before generating an answer2. This helps improve accuracy, reduce misinformation, and provide more up-to-date responses.

*RAG is a hybrid system that combines two components:
Retriever – Fetches relevant documents or data from an external knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia, a database, PDFs).
Generator – Uses a language model (like GPT) to read those documents and generate an answer.

*Some real-world applications of RAG technology:
1.Customer Support Chatbots: RAG-powered chatbots can pull relevant data from knowledge bases, FAQs, and customer records to provide accurate and personalized responses, improving customer service efficiency.

2.Healthcare: Hospitals use RAG in clinical decision support systems, integrating electronic health records and medical databases to reduce misdiagnoses and improve early detection of rare diseases.

3.E-commerce: Platforms like Shopify’s Sidekick chatbot leverage RAG to provide precise answers related to products, account issues, and troubleshooting by retrieving store data.

*How RAG Works – Working Flow:
Here’s a simplified step-by-step explanation:
Input Query: The user asks a question like “What is the latest iPhone model?”

Retrieval:
The query is passed to a retriever (e.g., FAISS, Elasticsearch, or BM25).
The retriever searches a knowledge base (documents, webpages, databases) and fetches the top relevant documents/passages.

Augmentation:
The retrieved documents are combined with the original query and passed to the generator (like GPT or T5).
This helps the model understand the query in context with fresh or specific data.

Generation:
The model generates a final, coherent answer using both the query and the retrieved documents.
Output: You get an accurate and informative response, even if the data wasn’t in the model's training set.

*Retrieval: Finding the right information.
*Augmented: Helping/improving the AI.
*Generation: Creating the answer.



#LANGCHAIN
LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications using large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the process of:
Connecting LLMs (like GPT or Gemini) with external tools
Adding memory to conversations
Doing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
Integrating APIs, databases, and custom logic
LangChain helps developers build powerful, real-world LLM apps faster and more reliably.

🔄 How RAG + LangChain works together:
LangChain helps you build a RAG system easily.
LangChain is like the chef. RAG is the recipe. GPT is the brain.

🧠 Putting it all together: AI Chatbot with RAG and LangChain
You want a chatbot that can answer questions about your files.
LangChain helps you load the files, split them into pieces, and search them.
RAG is the method that uses those pieces to answer the user.
GPT or any other LLM is used to generate the final human-like reply.

🧑‍💼 User: “When is our next holiday?”
LangChain helps search your HR policy PDF.
Finds: “Company holiday: June 1st”
GPT answers: “Your next company holiday is on June 1st. Enjoy your day off!”
